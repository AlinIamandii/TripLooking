Learning actions order:
- new xUnit test project
	- update nuget packages
	- Reference the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing package for infrastructure components like test web host and in-memory test server
	- Specify the Web SDK in the project file (<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">).
	- install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer nuget package in order to test real integration with the database
	- database used in "Repository & logic(business) layer" training 
	- install Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client to post json async
	- create base integration tests class
		- create HttpClient - provide snippet in teams chat
		- cleanup database - by own, with help snippet if needed
		- create JWT token
				- request ideas from the students
				- provide snippet in teams chat
		- set authorization request header - by own
- create test class CommentsController
		- create test for get
				- define 3 AAA
